hn-comment-display-modifier
===========================

hn-comment-display-modifier is (currently) a bookmarklet that allows one to hide
and later display levels of hn comments.

The intent is to allow a reader to read all top level comments by hiding
replies, while easily allowing the user to dig into the discussions if desired.

## Usage

Go this repo's [gh-pages](http://ifo.github.io/hn-comment-display-modifier/)
and follow the instructions listed there.

#### TODO add images of the bookmarklet usage
